LumberCalc
==========

This script is for personal use in calculating the material costs for various woodworking projects.  It receives JSON files defining the parameters for the project and the cost list for lumber, then factors how much the project will cost for each species of wood.

**NOTE**: *LumberCalc is currently in development.*
